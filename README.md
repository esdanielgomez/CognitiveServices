# Workshop about Azure Cognitive Services and the human side of intelligent applications in MSP Tech Days

With Azure Cognitive Services, we can build apps that deliver intelligent, engaging, natural, more personal, and human experiences in the end of the day with the power of Artificial Intelligence and web knowledge. 

We can build apps based on powerful algorithms with few lines of code. There is no limit to what can be built. APIs incorporate Machine Learning and bring our ideas to life.

Below are some demos of various Azure cognitive services.

## Face API: Python SDK & Sample

This demo contains a Python implementation where you can test the different capabilities that the Azure Face API resource has for us.

## Custom Vision

Thanks to the service of Custom Vision we can create models of artificial vision to adapt them to a particular case. In this case, below is an article tutorial and the corresponding dataset to perform an image sorter with SPAM in CustomVision.

Azure resource required: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/

## Language Understanding

This is a service designed to identify valuable information in conversations, LUIS interprets the user's objectives (intentions), and extracts valuable information from sentences (entities) for a high-quality nuanced language model. 

For this case, in this case we can find a file with the list of phrases to perform the process of specifying intents and entities within the platform available to work with this service.

## Intelligent Translator

Application in Python to translate by voice from one language to another. This thanks to the Azure Cognitive Services: Speech and Text.

To run the application, the licenses of those two services are required:

Azure resource required 1: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-US/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/

Azure resource required 2: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-US/services/cognitive-services/translator-text-api/
